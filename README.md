# wickedMonkey
我的猴子包
My project is called wickedMonkey, which is a web script written based on Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/), which enhances the functions of web pages. To give a few examples:
# autoJumper.user.js 
realizes the automatic jumping of web pages. In China, when a web page jumps to another web page, sometimes there will be an intermediate page for the user to click the confirmation button. This script of mine can automatically click the confirmation button.
# biliMenu.user.js 
can enhance the functions of some pages of the website www.bilibili.com. My requirement is to summarize the videos on the webpage collection and make notes. This script can copy the title, duration, and link of these videos with one click. , copy them into clipborad then i will organize to my notes tool evernote, also a dialog to display the total duration of these videos.
